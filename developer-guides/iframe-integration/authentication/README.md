# What is `iframe` auth?

With `iframe` auth you can use your own authentication page/API to log in users on Rocket.Chat.

When enabled Rocket.Chat first do an `XMLHttpRequest` to the `iFrame API` URL trying to see if the user is already logged in at the third party website. If that doesn't succeed then Rocket.Chat will present the `Iframe URL` within an `iframe`, so the user logs in on the third party website which means he is authenticated on Rocket.Chat as well.

We have developed an example app written in NodeJS in order to help you understanding this authentication flow. Please take a look at [iFrame Auth Example](https://github.com/RocketChat/iframe-auth-example)

## Configuring

### API URL and API Method

Configure how Rocket.Chat will call the third party system to either login or to verify if the user is already logged in, by setting `API URL` and `API Method` fields.

`API URL` refers to endpoint on the third-party system that will check if the user is already logged in to that system. The `API Method` is used to select the submission method Rocket.Chat will use to submit information to the `API URL` (for instance using `POST`).

If the user has already logged into the third-party system, the `API URL` should communicate to Rocket.Chat and return a JSON object containing either a `token` or `loginToken` property, otherwise (if the user is not already logged in) the `API URL` should return an empty body with status `401`.

The choice of which property `API URL` will return depends on how the third-party system decides to interface back with Rocket.Chat, as described in one of the two ways below:

#### Using Rocket.Chat API

If you have the user's password stored (or it is the same between your third party system and Rocket.Chat), you can use [Rocket.Chat's REST APIs](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/authentication/login/) to log in the user, this way you will get an `authToken` back from Rocket.Chat that should be returned as `loginToken` by your endpoint.

At this point, if the user does not have a Rocket.Chat account yet, you can either use Rocket.Chat API to [create an user](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/users/create/) using a admin account or [register him](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/users/register/).

After you log the user in, you should return a payload like the following:

```json
{
  "loginToken": "already-saved-or-returned-login-token"
}
```

#### Managing MongoDB directly

In the case you have access to Rocket.Chat's database, you can connect there directly and manage the user record by yourself. This might be useful if you have MongoDB on your stack already and don't want to learn Rocket.Chat's API.

To do so the endpoint should connect on Rocket.Chat's MongoDB database and make sure the `generated-token` is saved on `users` collection on the corresponding user record. The `generated-token` should be saved on the field path `services.iframe.token`. This is how the user record should look like:

```javascript
{
  "_id": "MZiFvWAf96876875u",
  "createdAt": new Date(1432252673528),
  "services": {
    "iframe": {
      "token": "generated-token"
    }
  },
  "emails": [
    {
      "address": "useremail@gmail.com",
      "verified": true
    }
  ],
  "name": "John Doe",
  "username": "john.doe",
  "active": true,
  "statusDefault": "online",
  "roles": [
    "user"
  ],
  "type": "user"
}
```

On this case, the response should be:

```json
{
  "token": "generated-token"
}
```

### IFrame URL

The URL of the page you want to show as the login page of your Rocket.Chat instance (this page can be created in any programming language and/or web framework).

The login page will then communicate back to Rocket.Chat using `postMessage` API.

After user logs in, you have to authenticate him on Rocket.Chat side, pretty much the same as you did before on `API URL` endpoint, but now you should return a JavaScript code that will be rendered within the `iframe`, depending how you logged in the user:

- If have used Rocket.Chat's APIs to log in the user or already have user's token saved in your end, return:

```javascript
<script>
window.parent.postMessage({
  event: 'login-with-token',
  loginToken: 'your-token'
}, 'http://your.rocket.chat.url');
</script>
```

- If you have saved user's token connecting directly to Rocket.Chat's database on the user's field `services.iframe.token`:

```javascript
<script>
window.parent.postMessage({
  event: 'try-iframe-login'
}, 'http://your.rocket.chat.url');
</script>
```

### Using OAuth configured on Rocket.Chat's end

If you have OAuth services configured on Rocket.Chat, you can trigger them from within your login page as well.

To implement this authentication, after triggering the OAuth authentication you will receive a `postMessage` back from Rocket.Chat with user's credentials response from OAuth service. You need to manage the user creation/authentication on Rocket.Chat's database by yourself, the same as described earlier.

#### Facebook

```javascript
window.parent.postMessage({
  event: 'call-facebook-login',
  permissions: ['email']
}, 'http://your.rocket.chat.url');
```

The reply will be a postMessage back to your page with:

```javascript
{
  event: 'facebook-login-success',
  response: {
    // authResponse: Object
    // accessToken: "a7s6d8a76s8d7..."
    // expiresIn: "5172793"
    // secret: "..."
    // session_key: true
    // sig: "..."
    // userID: "675676576"
    // status: "connected"
  }
}
```

Or an error

```javascript
{
  event: 'facebook-login-error',
  error: error,
  response: response
}
```

#### Google

```javascript
window.parent.postMessage({
  event: 'call-google-login',
  //  scopes:
  //  webClientId:
}, 'http://your.rocket.chat.url');
```

The reply will be a postMessage back to your page with:

```javascript
{
  event: 'google-login-success',
  response: {
    // "email": "rodrigoknascimento@gmail.com",
    // "userId": "1082039180239",
    // "displayName": "Rodrigo Nascimento",
    // "gender": "male",
    // "imageUrl": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-shUpniJA480/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAqY/_B8oyS8yBw0/photo.jpg?sz=50",
    // "givenName": "Rodrigo",
    // "familyName": "Nascimento",
    // "ageRangeMin": 21,
    // "oauthToken": "123198273kajhsdh1892h"
  }
}
```

Or an error

```javascript
{
  event: 'google-login-error',
  error: error
}
```

#### Twitter

```javascript
window.parent.postMessage({
  event: 'call-twitter-login'
}, 'http://your.rocket.chat.url');
```

The reply will be a postMessage back to your page with:

```javascript
{
  event: 'twitter-login-success',
  response: {
    // "userName": "orodrigok",
    // "userId": 293123,
    // "secret": "asdua09sud",
    // "token": "2jh3k1j2h3"
  }
}
```

Or an error

```javascript
{
  event: 'twitter-login-error',
  error: error
}
```

## How to login in Rocket.Chat with default account system while in development

When you activate the IFrame auth you will not be able to access Rocket.Chat's default login page, however if still need/want to use your Rocket.Chat's credentials to log in, you can do that by opening the browser's Developer Console and executing the following code:

```javascript
Meteor.loginWithPassword('username-or-email', 'your-password');
```
