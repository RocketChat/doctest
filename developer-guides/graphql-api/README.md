# GraphQL API

Rocket.Chat now supports a GraphQL API.
> **This API is a work in progress, so feel free to test, ask us questions, and submit Pull Requests!**

The administrator must enable the GraphQL API in the admin panel (`General` -> `GraphQL API`).
After that, you are able to use the GraphQL API, under `/api/graphql` endpoint.
