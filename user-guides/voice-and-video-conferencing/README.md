# Voice and Video Conferencing

In Rocket.Chat you have the ability to start video and audio conferences.

This is done by using [Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/) through Rocket.Chat.

> Note: For this feature to be available for normal users, the server admin must activate it before. Please see [Setting up video conferencing](../../administrator-guides/setting-up-video-conferencing)

## Starting a Video Conference

To start a video conference you can simply open the channel actions menu (the three dots on the top right) and select `Video Chat`.

> If you cant see the `Video Chat` option on the channel actions menu, please contact your system admin, since video conferencing can be allowed only on private channels or on all channels depending on the server configuration.

Other users will be able to join via `Click to Join!` button that is sent as a message on the channel that the conference is being held.

## Screen Sharing

You can start screen sharing by selecting `Share screen` in the jitsi widget.

> Note: In Firefox screen sharing works out of the box, but if you are using chrome, please install this [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rocketchat-screen-share/nocfbnnmjnndkbipkabodnheejiegccf) to be able to screen share.
